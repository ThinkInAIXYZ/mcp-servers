# Go MCP Server List

This repository provides a curated list of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers implemented in Go. You can use these servers as references or starting points for your own AI context integration projects.

## Introduction

MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by either:
1. Adding your server implementation directly as a package in a folder

If adding a package directly, please create a `README.md` inside with author information. If adding a link to your own repository, follow this format:
